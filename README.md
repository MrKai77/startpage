A working **simple** startpage.

This is a really simple startpage. It provides the temperature, the time and a searchbar (which is disabled by default). There aren't any bookmarks, mainly because I don't use them.

To use this as your new tab page in Firefox, I used https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/ and I highly recommend it!
