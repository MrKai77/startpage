Yes, I know this is *really* simple. No bookmarks, no searchbar, basically only a clock and the temperature. But that's exactly what I was aiming for. A simple but effective startpage.  

Code is currently also **disastrous** ðŸ˜… so only look at it if you feel confident that you'll understand it. I might look into documenting and organizing the code in the near future.

To use this as your new tab page in Firefox, I used https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/ and I highly recommend it!
