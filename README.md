# startpage
A working **simple** startpage.

Yes, I know this is *really* simple. No bookmarks, no searchbar, basically only a clock and the temperature. But that's exactly what I was aiming for. A simple but effective startpage.  

Code is currently also **disasterous** ðŸ˜… so only look at it if you feel confident that you'll understand it. I might look into documenting and organizing the code in the near future.
